## Getting Cookies and User-Agent

For best results when downloading restricted content:

1. **Cookies**:
   - Install a cookie export extension in your browser
   - Visit YouTube and log in
   - Export cookies in Netscape format
   - Paste the content in the application's cookie textarea

2. **User-Agent**:
   - Visit [whatsmyuseragent.org](https://whatsmyuseragent.org/)
   - Copy your browser's User-Agent string
   - Paste it in the application's User-Agent textarea

**Important**: The User-Agent must match the browser used to export the cookies.

## Troubleshooting

### HTTP Error 429 (Too Many Requests)

If you encounter rate limiting:

1. Try using fresh cookies from a logged-in YouTube account
2. Ensure the User-Agent matches the browser used for cookies
3. Wait some time before retrying
4. Try using the VPNBook proxy functionality

### "Content Unavailable" Errors

1. Verify the video exists and is publicly available
2. Try using cookies from a logged-in account
3. Ensure your IP/proxy isn't blocked by YouTube
